## Project Background

>On the affiliate page we have several sections.
Starting from top to bottom we have a link to invite people to support us when they enter the application. We continue with the configuration section, where we can modify the profile image, name, affiliate code, logo at the top left and the color of the elements. Finally, we find four sections where statistics such as total profit, a list of all agents, a list of the last agents to join and another list of the agents who have contributed the most appear.

Afiliate Invitation:
>When we copy the affiliate link and open it in another tab, a record will appear with the affiliate configuration. In this record we see the code of the person we support.

Additional features:
>Apart from all this we wanted to add the Cirsa apple as an icon for all the tabs.

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AKing1997/Human-Learning-Cirsa.git

The application will be available in: http://localhost:5252.

## Stack Used

- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET y Blazor
- **Views:** HTML5
- **Styles:** Boststrap y CSS
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap

## Decision making
During development, fundamental decisions were made to ensure the success of the project in a limited time:

1. **Choice of Technological Stack:**
   > C# and .NET were chosen for their robustness, security, and ability to handle real-time transactions. Razor and Bootstrap were selected for the frontend due to their seamless integration with .NET and their ability to provide an engaging user experience.
2. **Security:**
   > Due to the short work time and project requirements, standard security practices have not been carried out, such as form validation, secure authentication and role-based authorization.
3. **User Experience:**
   > User experience was prioritized by designing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. We also wanted to maintain the essence of the official Cirsa page so that in a future implementation it does not look out of place. Bootstrap was used to ensure the affiliate page is accessible and attractive.

These decisions were made with the objective of providing an efficient solution, maximizing the user experience and meeting the specific requirements of the multinational in a limited time frame.
